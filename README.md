Detailed information about my capstone project for the #NG30DaysOfLearning
____
# Project name: Airplane crashes from 1908 - 2009

___
# Project Objective
This project aims to look at the data of airplane crashes from 1908 up till 2009. It aims to look into the following:
i. The numerous reasons for crashes and possible solutions
ii. The countries with the highest crash fatalities 
iii. The year with the highest fatalities

____
# Data Source
The data for this project was gotten from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908
More information about the data can also be the above website.

# Data Transformation
For the project, I made use of two applications: Microsoft Excel & Microsoft Power BI. Microsoft Excel was mainly used for the data cleaning stage while Power BI was mainly used for the visualization stage. 
For the cleaning stage, I first reviewed the data extensively to have a clear idea for what needed to be done. Ifirst fixed the typographical errors and then created a new column for the countries where the crashes occured. Then, I used Vlookup to merge rows that had states to their countries. I replaced the empty rows in the Summary column with UNKNOWN. After which, I created a new column for the different causes of the crashes. 
The causes were split into 7, namely: Collision (for crashes where two airplanes collided with each other or where an airplane collided into something), Fuel-related (for crashes that occured due to fuel issues, mainly because the plane ran out of fuel), Mechanical failure(for crashes due to engine failure, fuselage issues or fire starting inside the plane), Pilot error (for crashes that occured due to errors or misjudgements on the pilot or crew), Shot down (for crashes that happened due to the lsane being shot down), Unknown cause (for crashes where the causes were unknown, undetermined or where the plane simply disapperared) and Weather conditions (for crashes that happened due to weather conditions e.g rain, fog, snowstorm etc).

Then, I loaded the data into into Power BI. With Power Query, I removed a few columns and changed data types and loaded the data.  The next thing was visualization.
I used area charts, a pie chart, a map visual, a table visual and a bar chart .![Screenshot 2022-07-20 235828](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107150582/180098037-7efee7ce-01f9-44f4-9bf7-fb5fa3b995d6.jpg)
